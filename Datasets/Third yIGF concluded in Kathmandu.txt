Third yIGF concluded in Kathmandu
The third Youth Internet Governance Forum (yIGF 2024) has concluded. It was held in Kathmandu on Saturday (September 14). The ceremony was attended by various concerned bodies from international communities as well as nationals, including parliamentarians, who discussed Internet governance issues and multistakeholderism in depth. Over 70 youths from across Nepal participated in the program to discuss Internet governance.Speaking at the event, Aanand Gautam, president of Youth IGF Nepal, stated that internet governance is a continuous learning process. "I am very happy and proud to have completed the third yIGF. We will always be available to assist all youth with Internet governance. It's unpredictable to say what may show up in the next five years, but we should at least continue our effort," he said.
Similarly, at the ceremony, Lumbini Province MP Nim Giri asked, "When will the youth be responsible? Youth should be cautious about when and to whom they ask questions. Understanding media and digital literacy is essential for understanding what and how we see on the Internet. As a result, understanding Google as well as geography is critical for young people."Hence, yIGF Nepal organises annual multi-stakeholder open forums where young people can share their experiences, learn about Internet governance issues, and have their voices heard in national and international policy discussions.Similarly, Surendra Basnet, vice president of the National Youth Council, emphasised the importance of youth participation in all areas, particularly in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape. He said, "Such platforms help build the capacity of youth from various stakeholder groups on pressing issues of internet governance such as the digital divide, universal access, AI governance, and online freedom of expression."The Youth Internet Governance Forum (yIGF) Nepal is a youth initiative that received formal recognition from the United Nations Internet Governance Forum Secretariat in December 2021. Its chief goal is to encourage and engage young people in substantive discussions about Internet governance.
